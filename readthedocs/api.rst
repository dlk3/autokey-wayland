Autokey Scripting API
=====================

The following collection of convenience class methods and properties are available for your use in AutoKey scripts.  They expose AutoKey-specific features for your use.  AutoKey scripts are Python scripts, so almost any Python library can be imported and used in an AutoKey script.

The class names shown in these pages are extracted from the program source code during the autogeneration of these documentation pages..  The class names shown in this documentation have been "aliased" in the AutoKey API to make them easier for you to use when writing a script.  For example, the `Keyboard class page`_ documents a class called ``autokey.scripting.Keyboard``.  When this class is used in a script it can be called as just ``keyboard``.  So the ``autokey.scripting.Keyboard.press_key()`` method shown in the documentation is actually called in a script as ``keyboard.press_key()``.  This applies across the bopard to all of the API classes documented here.
