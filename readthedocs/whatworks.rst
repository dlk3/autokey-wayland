What Works & What Does Not
==========================

Wayland is designed to close the X11 security holes that allowed one
application to spy on another through the desktop.  Since AutoKey depended on
these security holes to do what it does, AutoKey has some limitations when
running under Wayland.

What Does Not Work Under Wayland
--------------------------------

- Some of the script API's "window" methods do not work under Wayland.  See 
  `this table`_ for a list of which API methods work and which do not.
- The "highlevel" API methods are not supported.  These were implemented in X11
  using the xautomation utility, which is not available under Wayland.
- Recording and playing back mouse movements is not supported on Wayland.  This
  was implemented in X11 using the xrecord utility, which is not available under
  Wayland.
