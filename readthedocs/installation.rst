Installing AutoKey for Wayland
==============================

AutoKey for Wayland can be installed on both X11 and Wayland systems.  On Wayland systems, it only works with the GNOME desktop.  The KDE desktop is not yet supported.

Installation packages are available for Fedora systems and for Debian/Ubuntu systems.  See the links below for instructions on how to install AutoKey for Wayland on your system using an installation package.

AutoKey for Wayland can also be installed by cloning the source from the GitHub repository and doing a manual installation.  This is useful if you use a Linux distribution for which there is no installation package, or if you are a developer looking to work with the code yourself.

Basic testing of these installation instructions has been performed on Debian 13.3, Kubuntu 24.10, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Fedora 41/42/43.
