Problem reports that could have been addressed by reading the FAQ, searching the AutoKey documentation, or doing an internet search will not receive much/any attention.

If you are reporting a potential problem, you must attach an AutoKey log file that captures the bug with debugging turned on:

- [] Quit AutoKey,
- [] Delete your <code>~/.local/share/autokey/autokey.log</code> file,
- [] Run Autokey with the "-v" command line option,
- [] Recreate the problem,
- [[ Attach a copy of the resulting <code>~/.local/share/autokey/autokey.log</code> file to this bug report.

[!CAUTION] The autokey.log file will contain the keystrokes you made while running AutoKey.  Be sure that you remove any personally identifiable information, including passwords, when you post the file.
