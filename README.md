# AutoKey for Wayland (and X11, too)

This fork of the [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) project enables the unreleased code that the "develop" branch of the official [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) project contains to support the Gnome/Wayland desktop.  This fork contains fixes, plus additional changes and enhancements, to make AutoKey function properly in both the X11 and Gnome/Wayland environments.  

**Important:** This version of AutoKey currently only works with Gnome desktops under Wayland.  Under X11, it continues to work with any desktop environment.  I hope to extend Wayland support to KDE shortly, and to other desktop environments in the future.

[What Works & What Does Not](https://github.com/dlk3/autokey-wayland/wiki/What-Works-&-What-Does-Not)

Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora installation packages are available.  The AutoKey for Wayland code may also be cloned from GitHub, configured, and run manually.

## Support

Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/dlk3/autokey-wayland/wiki/FAQ-%E2%80%90-Frequently-Asked-Questions) first.

The [official AutoKey wiki](http://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki) contains a lot of useful information about how to use AutoKey, including many example scripts and the like.  Make use of it.

You may post questions or bug reports to this project's [Issues](https://github.com/dlk3/autokey-wayland/issues) tracker and I will do my best to address them.  As always, questions that could be answered by reading documentation or by using a search engine will not receive much/any attention.  Problem reports should always be accompanied by a full copy of your <code>~/.local/share/autokey/autokey.log</code> file that captures the problem while running autokey with the verbose ("-v") command line option.  See the [FAQ](https://github.com/dlk3/autokey-wayland/wiki/FAQ-%E2%80%90-Frequently-Asked-Questions#attaching-an-autokey-debug-log-to-a-problem-issues-report) for instructions.
